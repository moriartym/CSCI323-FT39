Maze Solvers

All maze maps are located in the `maze_map` directory:

- Perfect Map → Only one path to the goal
- Unperfect Map → Multiple paths to the goal

Shortest paths are determined using BFS (Breadth-First Search).

Map Sizes & Shortest Paths

Size            | Type      | Shortest Path Length
----------------| --------- | ------------------
Small (5x5)     | Perfect   | 5
Small (5x5)     | Unperfect | 3
Medium (11x11)  | Perfect   | 23
Medium (11x11)  | Unperfect | 9
Big (15x15)     | Perfect   | 20
Big (15x15)     | Unperfect | 16

Algorithms

All algorithm code is located in their respective directories.
Results are automatically stored in the same directories with matching names.

Q-Learning (Q-Table)

Implements Q-Learning using a Q-table.

Run:
python3 qtable/qtable.py <maze_path>

Example:
python3 qtable/qtable.py maze_map/perfect_small_maze.txt

- A training_log.txt file will be created automatically.
- Progress will also be printed to the console in real-time.

Deep Q-Network (DQN)

Implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for maze solving.

Run:
python3 dqn/dqn.py

- Progress will be printed directly to the terminal.
- To change the maze, edit line 766 in dqn/dqn.py and update the path.
- To save the output:
python3 dqn/dqn.py >> <save_file_name>.txt
- Press Close on the Pygame maze window to finish training and print results.

SARSA

Implements SARSA for maze solving.

Run:
python3 sarsa/sarsa.py <maze_path>

Example:
python3 sarsa/sarsa.py maze_map/perfect_small_maze.txt

- To save the output:
python3 sarsa/sarsa.py <maze_path> >> <save_file_name>.txt
