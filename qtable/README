Note :
aldous Broder Algo is used to create the maze, which guarentee a perfect map
a random wall destroyer function is created to make the map unperfect
Perfect map -> there is only 1 path to the goal
Unperfect map -> there is mutiple path to the goal
BFS is used to determine the shortest path

Small Map (11 x 11)
perfect small maze shortest path length : 21
unperfect small maze shortest path length : 16

Medium Map (21 x 21)
perfect medium maze shortest path length : 49
unperfect medium maze shortest path length : 30

Big Map (51 x 51)
perfect medium maze shortest path length : 150
unperfect medium maze shortest path length : 184
